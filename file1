Distributed Architecture: Unlike centralized systems, every developer has a complete local copy (clone) of the entire project history. This allows for offline work, faster operations, and a robust implicit backup system, as the project can be restored from any client's repositorySnapshots, Not Diffs: Git primarily stores project history as a series of snapshots. When you commit, Git records a picture of what all files look like at that moment. For unchanged files, it only stores a link to the previous identical file, making storage efficient.
